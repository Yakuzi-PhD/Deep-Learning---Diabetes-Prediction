Deep Learning - Diabetes Prediction of Pima Indians

Using Keras with TensorFlow Backend in an python anaconda 3.5 environment.

Currently predicts dualistic classification of diabetes development within the next 5 years with an approximate accuracy of 80%.

Setup:

- 8 input nodes, RELU activation function
- 4 hidden layers with 8 nodes each, RELU activation function
- A singel output node with a Sigmoid activation function
